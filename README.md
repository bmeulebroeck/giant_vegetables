# giant_vegetables

Project: Use BeautifulSoup to scrape weigh-off results for multiple years of giant vegetable competitions (pumpkins, tomoatos, watermelons, long gourds, etc.)

Each category has it's own scrape notebook due to some minor differences in the source data tables.

Data gathered from Bigpumpkins.com: http://www.bigpumpkins.com/ViewArticle.asp?id=132
